      Yesterday, All those backups seemed a waste of pay.

     Suddenly, There's not half the files there used to be, 
     And there's a milestone hanging over me. The system crashed so suddenly. 
     I pushed something wrong, What it was I could not say.

      Yesterday, The need for back-ups seemed so far away. 
      I knew my data was all here to stay, 
      Now I believe in yesterday.
